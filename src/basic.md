Each training is most commonly taught over six sessions (approximately 2 hours each), with a small group of participants (e.g. 5-10 people). However, it can easily be adapted for other scenarios, such as one-to-one or classroom settings.

Most of the content is contained within the 3 Google Slide files, one for each topic. We also provide lots of additional resources, such as templates and the original source files for graphics.

Adapting the material to your own situation is highly encouraged. You may modify it in any way you would like. Simply make a copy of the files to your own Google Drive and you'll be able to edit them.

Please do apply your own church or conference branding to it. There is no need to acknowledge the original material, though it may be helpful to link to it somewhere so others know they can use it themselves as well.
