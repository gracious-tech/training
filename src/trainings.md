## Normal use

Each training is normally taught over six sessions, with a small group of participants (e.g. 5-10 people). However, it can easily be adapted for other scenarios, such as one-to-one or classroom settings. They are intended to be completed in order, as they build upon each other.

Each of the six sessions usually requires 2 hours for the content, not including time for fellowship or breaks.

There are extensive leader notes attached to every slide that can be read while presenting or can be printed into a leader's booklet. Participants should also receive copies of the slides, either digitally or via a printed booklet.
