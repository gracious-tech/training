# About

This training was first developed in 2024 for a conference in Sydney, Australia. It was inspired by similar trainings called "strands" that are run by a number of organisations in Sydney. This training was specifically designed to improve upon existing material in the following ways:

 - Free of copyright -- So it can be shared and improved without restriction
 - Easy to adapt -- All source files are provided and are easily editable
 - Easy to translate -- Western metaphors have been avoided as much as possible

The material is written from a Reformed Evangelical perspective. The [Berean Standard Bible](https://bereanbibles.com/about-berean-study-bible/) (BSB) is used for quotations of Scripture since it is high quality and [non-commercial](https://sellingjesus.org/articles/bible-publishers).

You can learn more about the importance of removing all copyright restrictions from ministry resources at [Let's copy, church](https://copy.church). You can also dive into the theology of free giving at [Selling Jesus](https://sellingjesus.org).

## A prayer

The hope is that this training will be the start of something much greater. A future where everyone in the world can access high quality biblical training completely free of cost and copyright restrictions. Where young pastors can study advanced levels of theology, even to the level of master degrees, completely for free. Pray God would raise up godly teachers who are willing to share their knowledge without conditions.
